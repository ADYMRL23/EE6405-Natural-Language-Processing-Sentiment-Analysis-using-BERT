Mental Health,"Manic only when on SSRIs I am 37F. I have had two severe psychotic manic episodes in the last two years.  Both times, I was on Zoloft.

For the first one in summer 2021, the pharmacy messed up my Zoloft dose and I was taking 1.5 times as much as I should’ve been.  It was a euphoric mania, and it occurred during a period of extreme stress from a divorce as well. I also started taking a 5-htp supplement around the time of my episode. I was hospitalized. I was also on lamotrigine at the time. 

I gained a ton of weight from both the antipsychotics and lithium. I went off antipsychotic first, seroquel, that caused me to gain around a pound every single day. Lithium I stayed on longer but I gained around 5 pounds a month. 

I then fell into a severe depression.  Like unbelievably severe. I thought I had had severe depressive episodes before, but I was wrong. I was not functional and planning my suicide. My psychiatrist initially refused to prescribe an SSRI, or put me on vyvanse, what I used to take for adhd and also helped with depression. I eventually talked him into it, I can’t remember exactly how.  I was also on lamotragine I think I would’ve died if I had not been out on Zoloft at that time. But it was a lower dose. 

Fast forward, during a time of work stress maybe 6 months later, I slipped into a more agitated mania. I was also on lamotrigine.  I was again hospitalized, stopped taking Zoloft and vyvanse, and went on Zyprexa and lithium. 

Weight gain with Zyprexa was still significant but leveled out relatively quickly, and lithium doesn’t seem to be an issue this time.

After writing a book, I guess my main question is- does anybody here only go manic on SSRIs?  In the past the one other time I was on one it caused rapid mood cycling, and so did Zoloft until I was on lamotrigine. I’ve been labeled as bipolar I, which I initially  talked him out of and he changed it to not otherwise specified, until I had my second one. I’ve been told the average age for first mania for a woman is 31, and I was 35.  But I don’t think it was a coincidence they were both on Zoloft. I am pretty convinced I won’t go manic without Zoloft or another SSRI. But I can’t afford to take the risk. Which means I’m stuck on meds I may not need for basically forever. Has anyone had a similar experience?"

Mental Health,"After years of struggling with my own mind, I finally decided to go see a doctor the other day. As we were talking, he asked a bunch of question about my insecurities and anxiety, my hundred of ups and downs. And by the end of my appointment, he just told me that there was a lot of chances I may be bipolar. For now, he gave me some pills for my insomnia, he said that it could just be caused by the lack of sleep. A part of me wishes it does but deep down, I know it’s more than that. And now I’m just scared, scared cause all I wanted was the doc to tell me everything will be normal, but it wont, it never is and I don’t know what to do with that. I’m just fucking scared"
Mental Health,"Dissatisfaction is Eating Me Alive One of my biggest struggles with bipolar is a constant feeling of boredom and dissatisfaction in my life. For as long as I can remember, if I'm not doing exactly what I know will make me happy (often I have 0 idea what this even is) I get this feeling in my stomach and chest that makes me feel hot, anxious, uncomfortable, and general just bad.
Sometimes I wake up from a shitty sleep, my coffee tastes like garbage, my pets are driving me nuts, I don't have anything to eat, it's cold, EVERYTHING just feels like it's wrong and sometimes this lasts for days. I struggle to keep hobbies but recognize that I can't just spend money whenever I want though it makes me feel better. Recently, I am very agitated as well. When I'm dealing with this boredom it makes me mean and snappy. I live with my partner and I love him and our life so much but some days just being in the same room as other people causes the burning in my chest and stomach. Maybe these are depressive episodes, but until now my lows weren't like this. 

What is everyone doing to combat such boredom and emptiness? I feel like I'm running out of ideas and options."

Mental Health,"reading through this sub feeling like i fit in for the first time in my life i’ve spent so much of my life feeling like a complete freak who doesn’t fit in anywhere, it’s made me avoid social situations and relationships because i’m so terrified of someone realising i’m not normal and hating me for it - then in turn missing out on those experiances &amp; relationships just makes me feel even more like an outcast who shouldn’t exist 

i’ve tried on so many hats for why i feel like this (social anxiety, autism, cptsd, etc etc) but they never fit right and i just feel so much more shame. then i stumbled on an infographic about personality disorders, looked up this sub and everything written here felt so familiar. so much of my anxiety came from feeling like i was alone in my experiences so it’s so comforting knowing all of you are here and exist somewhere in the world. 

i just wanted to say thank you all 💛"

I feel like I am being selfish but I have really wanted to leave for the longest time now but the concept of like, money and living necessities has baffled me. I have always thought of the future and what I am going to do but living situation has always been a hard stop. College debt is also scary, I cannot wrap my head around any of this b/c I keep thinking abt how things might go wrong. I am only in highschool and I have constantly heard ppl say that this is not smth I should worry abt but I cannot help but worry.

Mental Health,"I had a test today that has been on the schedule for three weeks. I studied and studied and stressed over it to the point where my period was late for 7 days which has never happened before. It was all I could think about. After the flight (it was a flight test, in the air, I am an aviation major) when my instructor told me hes not passing me on the test, the disappointment I felt in myself was so immense. It took every thing I had not to burst into tears while he went through the flight and detailed every single thing that I did wrong. I tried so hard for this test, everybody I talked to about it said you will do great! you always do! you got this! it will be amazing! and I think that is another reason it hit me so hard , bc I was so fucking embarrassed. I do not fail things. The whole time he was talking I just could not stop the thoughts of how worthless and stupid I was. It just kept repeating itself over and over in my head, his mouth kept moving saying the reasons why I failed and my brain kept telling me that I should just kill myself there is no point in trying so hard if this is the result, I wanted to hurt myself so so so bad. For some reason there is a sharp blade in my car and a few weeks ago I discovered that its very effective in making myself bleed. Its kind of like a scalpel? Again, I do not know why its there but it is (I think its like an eyebrow shaper or something my sister left in there??) but anyways it was basically all I could think about. When I left, of course, as soon as I got in the car I could not stop the tears from falling, any sort of negative feedback from a parent, teacher, colleague, etc always hits me so hard. I HATE being critiqued bc I am a perfectionist so there is usually nothing to critique. But anyways I kept myself from cutting somehow, the scars have been adding up and I do not want anybody finding out, there is only so many times you can blame it on the cat, or a branch, or the dog, whatever. I still had to release that disappointment in myself though so I ended up slapping myself a lot which ofc made things worse. and my face still hurts. Lol the amount of times I almost flipped my car on the highway tho on the way back to my apt, man Ill tell ya, it was difficult to not. My dog is the only reason I am alive I swear, thinking about him was the only thing that kept me going. When I got back I cried some more then fell asleep next to my doggo. I still feel worthless and the thoughts are terrible in my head and I wish I were dead but here I am venting to random strangers on reddit bc I feel guilty thinking about how my family would react if they found out I was dead. Its not fair that I am alive right now, I do not want to be, so why do I have to suffer for the next eighty years. I think deep down its why I chose to become a pilot, so I could kill myself easily if I needed to. If my family were all dead, god, I would jump off a bridge so fast. Anyways, moral of this story which is my life is think twice before you fail a student or tell someone something bad about them, you do not know their frame of mind and you may just be the reason they needed to kill themselves. This is not even a fiftieth of all the reasons I want to die, but the fact that just failing this test which I can retake btw, triggered me so much, I just do not want to do life anymoreI have a head ache from crying so much its so weird I almost never cry but lately its been happening a lot more. I think my body and will are starting to give up on my mental state so its not holding the tears back any more idk idk why does crying feel so terrible"

Mental Health,"Is it bad if your antidepressants makes you feel happy (I'm not talking about dangerous mood elevation)? I'm not talking about mania or hypomania here. But in the past I increased my escitalopram dose a few times. I was really ""climbing the ladder"" dose-wise (I think that I had to increase the dose over and over in order to keep the ""happy"" effect going) so I had to quit and come back down to the proper dose. I felt unbelievably great as I increased the dose. I took notes on my experience and I was just saying how great I felt and how I had nice memories of my family and my past...my mood was just great.

Antidepressants have been in use for a while now so I'm sure there's some wisdom about (1) whether being happy like that is sustainable, (2) whether it's healthy or not, and (3) whether I could've actually ended that phenomenon of chasing the effect up the ""dose ladder"" and gotten the effect to ""stick"".

Most importantly, when the ""happy"" effect was in place all my ADHD medications were working. This was absolutely life-changing. I can read in my notes that it says over and over ""if I could only maintain this level of healthy brain-functioning and ADHD-medication effectiveness then I would have a great life"". I wonder if there's anything to be learned from this whole experience that I had with the escitalopram and the ADHD medications; maybe the experience can provide a clue as to what to try in order to have a sustainable foundation for my ADHD medications.

I do have some anxiety/depression/OCD; I don't think that it's at the clinical level. I mean, I looked up the criteria for OCD and one of them said something about the issues taking up an hour of your time each day, so I'm far from that. And when it comes to depression and anxiety, it's a situation where I have mild issues where you could probably say that it's unhealthy for me to have the negative tilt to my emotions that I have...again it's nothing clinical, though."

Mental Health,"I was using her phone because I wanted to buy something on a random website. I saw that she was using private browsing, I looked into it and here is what I saw : suicide sleeping pills forum.I cannot even fully describe the feeling of dread that invaded me at this moment. I felt desperate, sad, angry... My mom does not have an easy life : in 2019 she lost like 70% of her left feet capacity and had to undergo two back surgeries. She has to take morphine everyday to fight the pain but she is still in pain. My mom was a very active woman and the fact that she cannot run, jump, or even walk properly makes her really depressed. She also has financial issues because her salary is trash and she is working a dead end job that she hates. My father is not really helpful and she thinks hes not in love with her anymore, my dog whom she loved dearly passed away in April and I am moving away in September. I absolutely want to leave because my mom is kind of toxic to me and I want to start a new life, but at the same time I do not want to because I do not trust her anymore.My dad made a suicide attempt in 2015. Hes better now but I cannot help feeling extremely angry that both my parents wanted to die at one point. I wish they never had kids to be honest. I hate them but I do not want them to die and abandon me because I love them more than anything else in the world. I do not know what to do. I cannot even talk to her right now but I know I have to help her. But how can I help her? I know we should never make a suicidal person feel guilty or selfish because it will not help them, but I am so mad at her. I am only 17, and even though Ill be an adult soon I am way too young to deal with this. And I am just plain tired. This year has been hell to me, I was depressed and was dealing with an eating disorder, my dog died... why cannot everything be fine? Am I not enough for my parents? I do everything I can to help my mom, but it seems to be pointless. I do not know what to do to make her happy. I tried everything I could. I am her daughter and I cannot even make her slightly happy. Sometimes I feel useless. I do not think my parents love me that much now. I do not know what I have done to deserve this. I am miserable and life is just so unfair Its about my mom"

Mental Health,"Hello people, how are you?I am an university student and currently I am on my winter break. It lasts a month and its becoming tiring and really boring.As I said above, when I am free from any compromise like studying or anything else I feel sad. I become sad out of the blue, usually at night of course. I think of my life, of my friends and I usually get jealous of them (usually girls that i like hahah).However, I do not think my life is bad, it is just very plain and with no big things happening. It does not help that I live in a boring and small town in the middle of nowhere for now.My days are really boring because I do not have anything to do, I feel unproductive and I cannot focus on reading what I like. Nor practicing other things I like like languages or math. I am always listening to music (usually jazz, Frank Sinatra or old rock).In spite of this situation I go through every summer or winter break, I enjoy studying when I have to. It makes me feel I have a purpose to do what I am doing, even if I fail. It does not demotivate me, I kept on studying and trying. And I feel very happy and excited.Just that, It is not my purpose to seek any professional help nor I am desperate. It was just to share my experience, maybe as a relief for myself. I feel sad when I have nothing to do"

Mental Health,Hating any kind of attention I definitely start to avoid people once I pick up on any small hint they’ve started to dislike me. But does anyone panic and start to avoid people if they show too much interest? It’s like I can’t tolerate more than a moderate level of attention directed towards me and I feel the need to disappear. My therapist calls it dissociating from people.

Mental Health,I have struggled with mental health for a long time but lately I have been hurting in a way I have never felt. Almost like I am mourning myself when I am not even gone yet. I am going about my days as normal as possible and feel like an empty vessel. It has been so hard to get myself back on my feet and I feel so alone in my journey. I feel most alone when I try to open up to family and friends but they cannot understand. I used to be so put together and my life has just been falling apart. I feel more and more like a disappointment and burden to others. I recently suffered a traumatic injury. I have been playing that off too but I feel different now. After everything I just do not have energy for anything. I feel like my light went out. I am not doing okay
Mental Health,"Hypomania and self control I need help. I need help. I know I am the only one who is responsible for the behaviours I produce, I know I have to help myself, but I need help.

I have the opportunity of my life, to enter a training that might lead to employment with a big software company, it is something that I never did before, I am excited and have big ambitions. Not to be the CEO, lol, just to follow my dreams in an environment that is beneficial for me intelectually.

But then again, I took the interview when I was on the low phase, and now the excitement has triggered my hypomania. I am a different person, to say so, from the one who applied. I am afraid they will realize I am mentally ill, unstable and possibly a liability for the company. I hope I am not a liability, but I feel like it when I take bad decisions because I am hypomanic, when I can't express myself clearly for the same reasons, when I do weird things, etc.

Tomorrow is my first day of training. I am pondering if I should double my antipsychotic dose (got approval to do it when I am not well, from my pdoc) or just go there as I am and deal with my mood, stay focused no matter how much effort that takes.

I need to be stronger than I think I ever was. More disciplined than I honestly think it is possible for me. I just met my own limits and I am so very scared."

This is a trigger warning, because even though I would probably despise you, I respect your membership in a ""moral community."" I am going to vent some things that contribute to my depression. do not read it, straight up. To preface, I am not some 14 year old kid struggling with new emotions. I am 31, and I have experienced pretty much exclusively low points throughout my life, interspersed with extensive, mind-destroying misery that nearly killed me several times. I am convinced, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that 99% of humanity is sinister in nature, and wicked in their actions. I hate you, very genuinely. My entire being is consumed by an unquenchable hatred for my fellow human being. I was not always like this, though. I was a nice kid with a big, loving heart, even though my parents were meth head trailer trash. My innocence was systematically stolen from me over the course of my early years. I learned to hate, and I eventually lost my ability to trust other humans on any level. I literally cannot maintain any relationships, and I live in complete isolation, waiting to die. I had early childhood issues with abandonment that made me feel like everyone was going to suddenly leave me. I was not wrong. People are shit, and they will stick around as long as you have something that they want. You, the person reading this, are like this. No matter what you think about yourself, you are not loyal to anyone but yourself, and you probably do not even know it. Only broken people can truly understand the ramifications their actions can have on others, because they were once victimized by another's selfishness - their willingness to use you to attain a need or desire of some kind. In order to *truly* understand that, you have to have experienced trauma. Real trauma. Not ""I got a spanking when I was 10."" The kind that actually fucks you up forever. *trigger warning for people who cannot validate my experience, while simultaneously expecting their own experiences to be validated* You, at the grocery store, staring at my ragged clothes and greasy hair, please go fuck yourself. Leave me alone. Mind your own goddamned business. You, in the car trying to run me off the fucking road while you text on your cell phone, I hope you crash and your car bursts into flames. You, neighbor, slamming your fucking fist on the wall whenever I walk across my house - whenever you do this, I have a panic attack. I imagine gruesome things about you, and all that separates us is a paper thin wall that I could crush through with my bare hands. Fuck you. If you knew my thoughts, you would move. You, the guy who stole my car a couple months back. I hope terrible things happen to you in prison. You, the employer who stole thousands of dollars from me and my employees while I managed your company and literally kept it afloat through 2020, I hope your fucking business goes under and your family goes hungry. Fuck you. I hope your mansion burns down. I could go on forever. I despise you all with all my soul. I just had to say some of this. Keep in mind that I do not care about your feelings, and I do not seek validation. I feel nothing but hatred and sadness."

Mental Health,"A story about my anxiety in the recent past, and issues i'm facing today (a little long) As my title says, I've been having an intense battle with anxiety lately. I have anxiety and depression that I was treating with Zoloft until the end of last February. I am a 21 year old male that lives in the Midwest.

**1. Last Year**

Around mid-june of last year, I had started to get some insomnia (the kind that wakes you up early), which I then blamed on the fact that my basement room is incomplete and family upstairs made a lot of noise. I also had brain fog, with all the complications that accompany it, which I had blamed on my lack of sleep. It sucked, but I decided I should wait for my mind to improve on their own. During this time, I had a slight, but long lasting, bit of anxiety about something unrelated.

During this time, I decided to drink 30ml of Zzzquil before bed in order to help me go to sleep quicker, and I would sometimes take a sip of it if I had woken up too early.

**2. A few months ago**

I lived with everything until mid-December, in which I started to have pain in my testicles and prostate, as well as my upper back and in random parts of my body. Long story short, I started to get intense anxiety about possible cancer. In order to slightly control it, I stopped drinking coffee every day and quit smoking weed once a week. Eventually, I had an ultrasound and a CT scan done, which found nothing. The symptoms associated with my lower region faded a couple of days after.

At some point along the way, I started having more symptoms, such as forgetfulness, possible confusion, numbness and tingling in my hands and feet, a feeling of dizziness or vertigo, a slight shaky feeling in my upper left arm, and what I can only describe as brain zaps. I also felt like my memory was getting a lot worse. These symptoms seemed to persist even on days when the anxiety seemed less bad. I made the mistake of googling my symptoms and good old brain cancer showed up. I pushed my doctor to give me an MRI, which later turned up nothing.

**3. A few days ago**

Over the time after I got the MRI results back, the anxiety seemed to come down from a constant 5-8 to a 2-3 (on a scale from 0-10), and while a couple of symptoms seemed to disappear over the next week and a half, I started to get new ones, such as random twitches and fasciculations in random, varying parts of my body (which I blamed on drinking coffee again) and trouble going to sleep/getting woken up in the middle of the night (which I blamed on weaning myself off of the Zzzquil I had mentioned before). When I started to go to sleep or wake up, I would also have thoughts that would make no sense. I still have these symptoms today, which is my motivation for writing this post.

I confess I still worried about things like spinal cancer and whether or not anything was actually wrong with me (aside from the anxiety), so I made the same mistake of googling again last wednesday. This time, I came across brain prion diseases, specifically vCJD, which threw me in to another state of panic and anxiety, possibly even greater than the last couple. 

**4. Today and the future**

This time, I'm worried that it might be the real deal, despite the hilariously low odds I have of actually having it. The worst part is, rationally I know I probably don't have what I'm so scared of. Luckily I had a doctor's appointment the next day after my latest googling mistake, and they set me up with a sort of behavioral counselor, as well as having me start on a different antidepressant.

I guess what I'm seeking by writing this post is reassurance that I won't be a clinically insane mess of a human due to some brain issue in 6 months. I'm constantly auditing my environment, past experiences, and my own thoughts in order to make sure I'm not hallucinating or something (like when I woke up around a week ago in the middle of the night to the smell of something burning, which could have just been my heater) 

I just feel skeptical sometimes that ALL of the symptoms I'm feeling or have felt can be due to solely anxiety, when it's never been this bad before.

The past few months have made me mentally tired, due to having to put up with the stress of daily life in addition to everything above. The insomnia and the anxiety have definitely taken a toll on me. I just hope it actually is just anxiety and nothing serious.

The only things that make me feel love in this world is music, yeah honestly music, where I can then daydream about a better place. I don't know I just feel tired of being alone, and I don't think it'll ever change, and its my fault no one elses. I wish that I could've lived a normal life, just to be a regular person like everyone else. They all understand each other. But life for me has always been so strange like I just wasn't supposed to be here, somehow I did end up here, I don't know why I'm here."

Mental Health,"I have had a funny feeling lately. Kind of unusual. Its like I woke up from a nap kind of late after a long day of work.When I awoke it was already dark, and suddenly my dark apartment felt extremely dark. And the Normal solitude I am accustomed to became so intolerable. It almost felt like a panic attack in a way.Yet my heart was not racing. Yet I felt on edge, and so so very alone.I busied myself with some quick chores. Suddenly a friend of mine messaged and I messaged them back quickly. They even called and its like I was so thrilled to talk with them for awhile and the feeling began to fade.I just do not understand it well.I have lived alone for several years nowand I am accustomed to it even prefer it at times.And yet waking up suddenly this evening the feeling of being alone felt like a prison. Completely intolerable.I was curious if anyone has ever felt anything like that. I know I have been a bit depressed latelyIm wondering if some of my anxiety symptoms are returning perhaps in a different way. Anxiety and depression about solitude?"

Mental Health,"Stress Headache? Hi 27M, 185lbs, 5'11 here. The last two days I've been pretty stressed out with work and started noticing that to the left of my left eye little close to the side forehead I've been getting this awful pinching feeling that comes and goes. I drink some caffeine during the day, but today decided to lay off of it and it's still coming in waves. The best I can describe it as a pinching vain. I started worrying that it might be a stroke or aneurysm but quickly chalked that up to just being anxiety. I've been feeling a little ""foggy minded"" too so I wonder if that has come to play too? Yesterday night I drank a few beers and it seemed to help, but then came back when I was sober. I take an antidepressant, and Ritalin daily but have been on them for years so I really don't think that's the case. Does anyone else get this headache feeling? if so, remedies? or should I go see a doctor? thanks."

Mental Health,"decreased need for sleep, difficulty taking meds:( i’m not sure where the best place to ask this is. i’m too afraid of bringing it up to my providers so i’m hoping i can seek support here before i mention anything.
i’m diagnosed bipolar type 1, i’ve only had one manic episode that led to psychosis. mostly, i struggle with rapid cycles of mixed mania, hypomania and depression when unmedicated.
the last maybe month or so(?) i guess i’ve had a decreased need for sleep. so much that my psychiatrist noticed it before i did and prescribed medicine for sleep. i’m taking my mood stabilizers regularly but for some reason i just cannot make myself take sleeping medication and these past two weeks i’ve noticed have been pretty worrisome while reflecting on it(change in sex drive and drugs, unlike myself and putting myself in dangerous situations) i’m just really afraid of bringing it up to anybody for fear of judgement. i know how silly it is to have the solution to my problem right in front of me, and i don’t want to make it seem like i don’t care about my mental health.
i am experiencing all symptoms of (hypo?)mania and some mixed features of depression. it was really nice for a few days of this week but just like my first manic episode, the only way i can describe it is like, you’re going so high up on a roller coaster that when you feel it slipping down, it’s scary and drastic and you do everything you can to keep going up just so it doesn’t crash. i feel like im in the beginning stages of that and i really don’t want to do this. the euphoria and attractiveness of mania is incredible, but the constant racing thoughts and heart rate, the irritability and anxiety are uncomfortable and i know im prone to psychosis.
it seems like the easiest solution would be to actually take my prescribed medication, but it is really hard for me. i feel like there’s so much more time i have to get stuff done later in the night and i see it as a waste to go to bed so early especially when i don’t need to. i’m aware of how ridiculous it all sounds but i don’t know what to do to make myself take the medication. i know i have to but i genuinely just do not want to, but unfortunately i know this is probably contributing to mania.
any advice or support would be helpful. thank you all who read"

Mental Health,"Anxiety about heart Last week I went to the emergency room for heart palpitations. They did a chest x-ray, EKG, and blood work. In the end, I was told that I had a spot on my lung and a slight irregularity in the EKG. Blood work was all fine. It was suggested I follow up with a cardiologist for an echocardiogram and 24-hour holter monitor and a radiologist for the CT. I had the CT scan done last Friday and it was a calcification in the lung (probably from a childhood of asthma, bronchitis, and pleurisy). No big deal. However, the palpitations had worsened to the point I couldn't sleep on Thursday (they're at their worst when I try to sleep). I spoke to the cardiologist and he suggested magnesium which has helped calm it down I think. However, I've now developed a cough which has been worsening over the last few days. I went in to the cardiologist this morning to get the 24 hour EKG put on and drop off the CT scan results and, just an hour after, the nurse called and asked if I would be okay to move my appointment from next Monday to this Friday at 9 am. I am completely freaked out that there is something really wrong--especially since the appointment was moved up. If the doctor had noticed anything really wrong, would he have gotten me in more immediately? I think all the anxiety about the condition is making all the symptoms worse and I'm not really sure how to stop it completely. Any advice is appreciated. "
Mental Health,"My depression room got infested with carpet beetles, probably because I left clothes on the floor for weeks and I don’t know what to do I don’t have the worst depression room but I let clutter, especially clothes build up on the desks and floor. I also struggle a lot with things like regularly changing out my sheets and blankets which definitely didn’t help. A couple days ago I saw a little bug crawling on my blanket. The last few days I’ve been finding more of them- another one on my bed, a few on my walls, my windowsill, in my closet, on the floor. I’ve been hypervigilantly looking for them at this point and changed all my bedding as well as finally washing some clothes but I think the damage is done. 

Because of the clutter, my room is filled with dust, especially in a few specific places, and I’m fucking terrified of what I could find there, especially under my furniture. But obviously I must already have an infestation. I’m scared to do ANYTHING in my room now because I know I’ll find more. My clothes that I couldn’t fit in the first wash round is still on the floor and I’m terrified to touch it because I feel like it’s crawling with bugs. 

I’m also guessing they’ve been there for way longer than I realize, so I don’t even know how long bugs have literally been crawling around in my bed with me. I was waiting for the day my room would get bugs and I’m guessing it happened recently because my parents stopped being on me much about cleaning my room after I turned 18. 

I’m planning to just suck up the shame and ask my dad to help me look and deal with the disappointment but I have to wait a week for him to come back from a trip. In the meantime I have no idea what to do because I feel like they’ll keep multiplying. Even starting to think about vacuuming and deep cleaning is overwhelming. Where do I even start???? Fuck"

Mental Health,(First post ever so uh bear with me?)Well. Honestly title says it all. I have always had an off and on relationship with depression and I go to counseling but sometimes it gets harder to deal with. Usually its just random times here and there and I can push past it. This time its feeling harder. I am losing a lot of my motivation and want to even do things. I am tired so much of feeling like this. The last time I spiraled I got into a really bad place and I do not ever want to do that again but i just do not know how to keep pushing this all away? I feel like I am spiraling again.

Mental Health,I need some advice My boyfriend has bipolar 2. Lately I've been noticing that his episodes of depression have been getting progressively worse. He's been missing work and sleeping most of the day away lately. I tried to encourage him to go to work this morning. I even told him to take it one step at a time and I would be there encouraging him throughout. He immediately said no. I tried telling him the same thing but with a different approach and he still said no. He started to get aggravated with me so I backed off. I've noticed that he's been getting slightly aggravated with me lately when I try to be encouraging so I'll back off and let him do his own thing once I detect it. The only reason why I try to encourage him so much is because I'm so used to doing it whenever I'm dealing with my own depression. I love him so much but I don't know how to fully get through to him without seeming to aggravated him. Can someone please give me some advice on what to do. Thank you in advance

Mental Health,"Old Man Gotama told his followers 2,500 years ago that those who are hurt are *burning* with self-pity, terror or revenge.

Mental Health,"What I see on Instagram IS real -- and it's killing me inside (A self-pitying post for your viewing pleasure) ""Stop self harming by stalking people yada yada yada"" -- *I know!!!!* I know I know better!

BUT.

I'm sick of being told ""they only show the happy moments."" No shit. But they *have* happy moments. They have adventures with friends that they post every other week, or even just every month, and some of them even post every week or more. I'm in my early 20s and so many people I went to high school with are traveling the world before they're tied down with more responsibilities and their bodies fall apart (mine already is...). Not because they're rich but because they're simply financially *comfortable* and have *connections* with people (social skills). And because they're not afraid to take risks. And because they've *built a life* for themselves, an identity, since early on in high school, maybe even earlier, which makes doing all of this feel normal to them, makes it all so much easier for them.

And if they're not traveling, they're still going on smaller adventures with friends and gfs/bfs. Or they're performing in a band at local venues (and they're actually good now). Or they're about to graduate college. Envy kills me.

I'm so fucked up, I took a ""gap year"" to figure out what I want to do with my life only to drop out of an overpriced community college this year because I still feel too directionless.

And I know I could have at least a small chance at what these people have if only I would get off my ass instead of sulking. I actually just checked (more like *stalked* because I'm not following any of these people) Instagram for the first time in months. Hurt even more than it did the last time. And in those months where I stopped looking at their lives, did mine improve? Did pretending they aren't living happy, fulfilling lives by avoiding their social media posts altogether make my life any better? Contrary to what every mental-health-guru-genius on Reddit claims: no, it didn't make my life any better. I'm still stuck. I try my hardest every day and I'm still stuck.

Sure. I've finally had a job at this point in my life (retail, but I snapped and quit). I can drive now, though I hate it. I can go by the mall by myself and do some shopping, not that I have money to spend. And yet it's nothing. It means nothing because it's not enough. Not enough for society and not enough to make me feel fulfilled because it means nothing without other people."

Mental Health,"I just keep throwing away my life. I just don't know what to do anymore. 25 year old female, diagnosed at 18 and have been taking lithium on and off. 

Well... I went off my medications again for a few months. I went off when I was done with school receiving a certificate for my future career. Well, I felt fine, as I am not working currently so don't really have any stressors. Before I went fully off my medications I was not taking them consistently and I quit one of my jobs of 4 years, started a new one (during the time I bought a house and was moving) and quit that one after a few months. The anxiety was the thing that was my problem, I was having massive panic attacks, and just had this intense self hatred for myself which then diminished my self-confidence entirely. Especially after just throwing away my life. 

Well just recently, I got a job in the career I was going to school for for so many years... and after day 1 I quit because I had a major meltdown. Could not keep food and water down, was cold sweats and shaking anxiety, it took me back to last year when I also had a similar meltdown. But this time it was so intense and different. I hate myself for quitting a professional job the next freaking day. How embarrassing, I literally threw away everything and I feel I will never be able to go back again. I now am deeply depressed and anxious. Cannot eat, keep waking up in a panic. I wish I never went off my meds, maybe I would have never quit the job and stuck it out. I don't know what my problem is. I just started my meds again, I am only on lithium ER. I am currently seeing a psych doc and I have kept her out of the dark about going off my meds and how I have been taking them so inconsistently. I also want to go on the anxiety med she recommended buspar, but I refused to try it because I thought I could beat it myself.. bipolar symptoms I have more control over. I am not sure if this is a part of bipolar or just separate generalized anxiety. 

Now everyone in my life thinks I am lazy and just don't want to work. But I do, I just keep fucking up because I won't take my meds. My boyfriend is currently paying all the bills, we just bought a house, so we are living pay check to pay check and I am afraid he will end up leaving me because of this. 

I feel as if its the end of the world."
